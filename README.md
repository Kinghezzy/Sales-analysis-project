# Sales-analysis-project
## Overview
 The project is aimed at analysing the monthly sales data of an electronic store. The data contains thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.
 We were able to answer questions like:
 What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
 In what city was the most product sold?
 What time should we display advertisement to maximize the likelihood of customers buying product?
 What products are most often sold together?
 What product sold the most? And Why?
 Credits to Keith Galli for the data and insight gotten.
